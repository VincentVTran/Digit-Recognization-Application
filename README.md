## Running the application

Run angular application- `ng serve --open` <br>
Run the neural network- `npm run ml` <br>
Run both applications- `npm run start` <br>

# MLRecognitionApp

The application currently uses Angular framework for the front-end user interface and ExpressJS as the back-end stand-alone application. Tensorflow was the primary framework used to build the neural network.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
